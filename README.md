In this game, you are stuck in a real jam - a pirate jam!

You are a pirate in search for treasure spots among the seven seas, which are, of course, marked by the 'X'! The wind is always blowing,  so you must rotate your ship's sails to change the direction to which you are heading. 

Although there aren't any other ships for now, throughout your travels you will find that there are still dangerous obstacles that might damage your ship if you crash into them, so be careful!

Some parts of the sea also have stronger currents which will give you a boost if you pass through them. Be sure to use them wisely!

Controls:

- A/D Left/Right arrows: turn the ship's sails
- Mouse Wheel: aim the ship's cannons
- Mouse Left Click: shoot cannonballs
- R key: restart the level
